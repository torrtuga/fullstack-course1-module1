//Installing Ruby on Rails

Install as per default settings.
But we have downloaded Ruby 4.1 and we need Ruby 4.2.3

In the command prompt type the following command : 

gem sources -r https://rubygems.org/ - to temp remove secure connection

gem sources -a http://rubygems.org/ - add insecure connection

gem update --system - now we're able to update rubygems without SSL

after updating do vice versa

gem sources -r http://rubygems.org/ - to remove insecure connection

gem sources -a https://rubygems.org/ - add secure connection

gem sources -r http://rubygems.org/ - to remove insecure connection

gem sources -a https://rubygems.org/ - add secure connection

gem update

CHECK : ruby -v
        rails -v
        git --version
        


//Installing PhantomJS

After extracting the file at a location add environment variable path with location "C:\phantomjs-2.0.0-windows\bin" i.e. the location where phantomjs executable file is stored
CHECK : phantomjs -v

//FINALLY
Now finally checking
rails new test_install
cd install_test
rails server
In the browser goto localhost:3000
